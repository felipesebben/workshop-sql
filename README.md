## Introduction
This repository contains annotations, references, exercises, and **projects** related to [Luciano Galvão](https://github.com/lvgalvao)'s SQL workshop. 

## Structure and Organization
Here follows a simple representation of the structure of the course:
```
project
│   README.md    
│
└───<lesson_number>_content
│   │   README.md
│   │   <sql_annotations>.sql
│   │
│   └───project
│       │   <project_exercise>.sql
│       │   README.md
│       │   ...
│   
└───<lesson_number>_content
    │   README.md
    │   <sql_annotations>.sql
```
The course is divided into four weeks, each of them dedicated to different parts of SQL-related subjects. By the end of the bootcamp, hopefully, this repository will contain a series of related material.

Link to the bootcamp's [GitHub main page](https://github.com/lvgalvao/data-engineering-roadmap/tree/main/Bootcamp%20-%20SQL%20e%20Analytics).

## Lessons
The bootcamp was organized into 13 classes:
- 01 - Overview and Preparation of the SQL environment
- 02 - SQL for Data Analysis: first queries
- 03 - SQL for Data Analysis: `JOIN` and `HAVING` in SQL
- 04 - Window functions
- 05 - Data Analysis project
- 06 - CTEs, Subqueries, Temporary Tables and Materialized Views (1)
- 07 - Stored Procedures
- 08 - CTEs, Subqueries, Temporary Tables and Materialized Views (2)
- 09 - Triggers and Second Project
- 10 - Transactions
- 11 - Order of Operations
- 12 - Database Indexing
- 13 - Database Partition

After a quick glance at the content, one can see that this bootcamp was not limited to one particular domain of SQL. Rather, it also includes areas such as definition and manipulation aspects too; these are crucial topics for data engineering.

### Scope
As previously mentioned, dtis bootcamp went far beyond the querying aspects of SQL (that is, commands that are related to the `SELECT` part of SQL). 

## Goals
Learning with no goals in mind is just entertainment. As such, this bootcamp is seen as a way to review, increase, and improve my SQL skills in a wider scope.
