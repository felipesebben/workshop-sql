## Introduction
In this introductory lesson, we installed the main applications and configured the databases that will be used throughout the course.

## Goals
Our main goals were:
- Understand Postgres and how it works as a relational database management system (RDBMS)
- Understand the concept of server/client
- Get acquainted with PostgreSQL and pgAdmin and understand how they work using the concepts of server and client
- Install all the necessary softwares and set up the database.
- Create a dummy database using the `Northwind` sample.
- Perform some introductory queries.


## Creating a Database
Here, we can either create a new database using the Postgres that we installed in our local machine. I decided to use Render's free SQL server so that I don't need to rely on localhost connections.
## Creating a Database
We created a database using the `Northwind` dummy dataset, provided by Microsoft (thank you!). It is a reliable database that will be used throughout the course.
## First Queries, Basic Operations
We also performed a series of basic queries, exploring Data Query Language operations - those will be the main subject of this lesson. For more information, visit the [basic_operations.sql](01-basic_operations.sql) file, which contains a few exercises and simple challenges.
